Notes for Networking lab session 1:

Chapter 1: R13, R18, P5, P10,P25
2 users can transmit at same time because of packet switching
probability of a given user is transmitting.
time slot divinded into 5 time slots. For each user 1/5

p = .2

(n r) p^r (1-p) ^(n-r)
(3 3) p^3 (1-p) ^(3-3)
= .2^3 = .008


packet length (L) = 1000 bytes
		= 8000 bits
Distance = (d) = 2500 km
Prop SPeed = (s) = 250000000 m/s
Transmission speed = (R) = 2mbps
			= 2*10^6 bps
